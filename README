Project description

A Traveling Salesman Problem is the task of finding the shortest 
roundtrip path a traveling salesperson can take to visit each vertex 
of a given graph. They are usually implemented using a genetic algorithm.  
   
S = {capitals of every country in Africa that is a recognized member of the United Nations} 

* Find the shortest roundtrip path that visits all the vertices in S, traveling along geodesics (that is, 
         straight lines over the surface of the earth).  [Important:  Do not add additional cities to your set.] 
* Include the optimal distance (rounded to the nearest kilometer) and a map of the optimal route.   
* Provide a list of countries (in alphabetical order) and capitals in your set. 
* Find the shortest path if we drop the condition that the path must be a roundtrip.
